/*Summary: When you need to display a literal quote inside a string, you escape
the string by surrounding the literal quote with backslashes.  This way JS will
not read the quotes as the end of the string literal, but display them as quotes
within the string literal.*/

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
