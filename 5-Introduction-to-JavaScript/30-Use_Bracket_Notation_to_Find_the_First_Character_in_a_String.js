/*Summary: We found the first letter of the lastName by using bracket notation,
a way to get a character at a specific index. Zero-based indexing means we start
counting from zero to find a specific character. */

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
