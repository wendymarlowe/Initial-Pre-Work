/*Summary: Do...while loops will first do one loop through the code, no matter what.
Then it will continue with the loop while a condition is true. It will exit the
loop once the condition is false.*/

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// myArray will equal 10 since the do runs no matter what. The while will not
//run since the condition is not met.
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
  console.log(myArray);
}
while (i < 5);
