/*Summary: We use bracket notation to access data within multi-dimensional Arrays
The first set of brackets refers to the items in the outer most array.  In this
example we are going to the third set of brackets and retrieving the second item. */

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
