/*Summary: You can construct a string from two variables and append them
together using the += operator.*/

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "exciting!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
