/*Summary: To get the last letter of the string, we used the length function and
subrtatced 1.  This gives us the character at the last index.  The length of
lastName is 8, but to get the index we start at 0, so the index of the last character
is 7.*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -1];
